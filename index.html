        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pottery/Ceramics ArtistðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">For as long as I can remember, I have developed my craft using earthquake putty as well as whatever clay I could get my hands on to create all kinds of things such as animals, cars, planes, ships of various sizes from films like the Star Wars franchise as well as ships of my own design, and I've even worked on scaled down models of people in real life and from various other mediums such as film, tv, history, or literature. I've made Pokemon, Aliens, and animals like lions, bears, elephants, horses, sharks, bulls, and even animals that don't exist with just an image or two to reference, my imagination, and however much clay I had in my hand at that time. <br><br>

        I didn't actually start working with real clay until my senior year of high school. With every opportunithy I had during my senior year, I'd got to my school's studio and Immediately begin working on any current or planning future projects. I'd spend most of my lunches, office hours, and every spare second in class to work on something new for myself or the people I cared about. I've made a mexican wedding vase, a couple dozen cups, a bust that was supposed to be Mark Hamill that ended up turning into Ghandi, a golem made out of a tree, multiple figurines of various designs that could have been used for DnD or displayed at home, and was even in the process of creating and finishing a mug that was designed to look like the helmet of the main protagonist from the hit Disney+ show The Mandalorian prior to the pandemic. I've created models for mythical creatures like the Minatour, a gargoyle, a troll, a rock monster, and a mermaid along with many others. One aspect I've focused on is capturing the details of the things that I creat. I've spent time making sure limbs were proportional, working on giving figures varying body types, the shape and size of a warrior's armor, the length of a woman's flowing hair, the shape oand length of a grown man's beard, the pieces of full on body armor, and the components of futuristic body armor to name a few of the things I've been focusing on. Because of the nature of earthquake putty, I am not able to maximize my time working on these minor details but I continue to do my best in order to improve as an artist.<br><br>

        My lack of 'official' experience is only matched by my desire to make high quality work that allows me to express myself and improve upon the size and design of my creations. I look to others, both professionals and artists who work with this form of art for fun as a means of learning how others are able to craft such detailed creations and the tools they use to do so. I've watched dozens of videos on the web, looked at various products online, and follow creators online to see how their styles differ and what characteristics I want to incorporate into my own. If I had to estimate, I'd say I've been working with clay for the last 12 years.
